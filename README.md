# Weather Dashboard

The Weather Dashboard Application provides the weather outlook for multiple cities.
This uses the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities.Also uses `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

Features include
* Shows current location weather conditions asking permission from the user.
* User can also search the city through the form input.
* Then will be presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
* UV index is presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
* 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity providing future weather conditions for that city
* Clicking on a city in the search history then again presented with current and future conditions for that city
